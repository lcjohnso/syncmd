# syncmd
BEAST-based Post-processing of Synthetic Stellar Populations

Purpose: Compute spectra and SEDs (using code from the [BEAST](https://github.com/BEAST-Fitting/beast)) for input synthetic stellar population (e.g., created using MATCH/fake), apply reddening and distance offsets according to geometric stars+dust model, and predict observed CMDs.
